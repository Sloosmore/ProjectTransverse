Hey! This is the repo I spent half a year working on (December 23 - April 24). The website accocited with this project in vrse.ai and the goal of the project was to create a AI notetaker for students with disabilities. I partnered with few colleges/highschools and had students with disabilites use it. Ultimently I got sucked into a few other projects and stopped working on it. This project was built in Express for backend, Supabase for DB, and vite react for front end.
