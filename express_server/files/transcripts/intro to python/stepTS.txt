The lecturer discusses the concept of type checking in Python. Python performs type checking to catch errors related to data types. However, it is noted that while Python may stop certain operations due to type discrepancies, it also holds the possibility of allowing erroneous values to propagate through a computation, leading to potential issues downstream. This underscores the importance of thorough type checking early in the process. Additionally, the lecturer mentions the presence of a spectrum for type checking across different programming languages, ranging from weak to strong typing.<2024-01-15T05:13:16.223Z> basically says how much type checking do they do now you're going to hear John and I go back and forth a lot as I said I'm an old time well I'm certainly old time but I'm also an old-time list programmer a love list but certainly in the category of a very weekly type language it does not check the types of its arguments at all python is I wouldn't say completely wrong nonetheless I'm also going to argue that it's probably not as strongly typed as we might like so for example there's an expression no less than is just if you haven't used it before just the operator you'd expect just comparing two things and it's going to return either true or false depending on the first argument is less than a second argument it's going to happen here again<2024-01-15T05:14:19.224Z> glasses on I can't see anything anybody Tas don't count they get their own candy yeah good question sounds like a reasonable guess right am I going to compare a string two number so see how good my name is not bad all right a good question sorry a good thought but in fact my younger son would say fudge knuckle yeah right this is a place I don't know about you John I think this is actually really not good because right what this is doing is it's allowing so let me back up and say it it's got an overload on the less than that allows you to compare basically the lexicographic ordering or this the sequence of ordering of symbols including numbers inside of the machine and this in my mind should have been an error I mean why in the world would you want to compare that just to give you an example of that for instance<2024-01-15T05:15:19.227Z> right the number four is less than the string three whereas the string for is not less than the string three and this is a place where it's comparing strings and numbers in a strange way so why am i showing you this partly to show you that it's kind of weird but also to tell you that one of the things you want to do is exercise what I'm going to call some type discipline meaning when you write code what types of arguments are operands you apply to operators cuz this is something that could certainly have screwed you up if you didn't realize it did it and you need to have that discipline to make sure it's doing the right thing<2024-01-15T05:17:02.223Z> one of the other things you're going to see is that some of the operators have odd meanings and again I think we look because in case you didn't understand one of them is Remember The Operators do look at the types so division for example 9 / 5 is 1 because this is integer division that is it's the largest number of integer multiples of 5 and there would be a remainder associated with it which is in fact four and again you got to be careful about how you use the operators alright suppose I look at that expression 3 + 4 * 5 3 right now I think one is 235 cuz this could be 3 + 4 * 5 or it could be three plus four times five and of course you know when you look at code it doesn't pause<2024-01-15T05:18:10.218Z> anybody know what happens in this case I'm going to try if I don't make it you know just get somebody to pass it oh I just hit somebody in the head thank you please pass it back to that guy if you want candy sit much closer down that way we can film you as well as we go along right so the point is there is something here called operator press basically things like exponentiation are done before you do multiplication or division which are done before you do things like addition and subtraction and so in fact if I wanted the other version of it in fact if I do this right is going to give me 23 because it does the multiplication first if I wanted the other version of it I need to tell it that by using excuse me in general what I would say is when in doubt
