I hear a size of relief okay good there we go better all right one of the things we showed last time is it operators are overloaded and this is where you heard John and I disagree I don't happen to like this but but he thinks it's an okay thing and in particular if we don't do that we do this that is give a combination of a number multiplication in a string this will in fact give us back a new string with that many replicas if you like up the screen right and if we want to do other things for example we can take two strings and add I'm sorry and add them togethernow sometimes things get a little interesting what's the value of that expression what do you think should happen if I evaluate that expression somebody with a hand up so I can see it it's going to happen why great people so by the way John's a Yankees fan he throws like like Johnny Damon I'm a Red Sox fan so we'll see if I how about that I'm almost hit John along the way great exactly what can I say all right so we're into bribing you as we go along here all right you'll be badly overweight by the end of the term because it doesn't know how to deal with this but there's an important thing going on here if I in fact wanted to combine those into a string I should have told the Machine by explicitly saying take that which is a number and convert it into a stringoptions if you have me back hey Google division board got it all written in detail fun little so what the f*** I'm listening to you I see nobody comma 10:00 I love this question OK Google phones are so different back in the day that's in Japan try not to forget your mouth in a second but thank you John for pointing it up thank you I was going to come to that in a second but thank you John for pointing it up right why is it a static semantic here yeah there's a second thing going on here that I want to highlightyes indeed okay there we go second thing I want to highlight is that what's going on is the python it's doing some type checking it caught the error because it checked the types of the offerings and it says I'm going to stop them together sounds like a reasonable thing to do but it's a dangerous thing because in doing that python would then have a value that it could pass on into some other part of a computation and if it wasn't what I wanted I might be a long ways Downstream in the computation before I actually hit some result that makes no sense and tracing back where it came from can be really hard so I actually want to have type checking as much as I can early on and in fact checking different languages on a spectrum from week to Strong typingbasically says how much type checking do they do now you're going to hear John and I go back and forth a lot as I said I'm an old time well I'm certainly old time but I'm also an old-time list programmer a love list but certainly in the category of a very weekly type language it does not check the types of its arguments at all python is I wouldn't say completely wrong nonetheless I'm also going to argue that it's probably not as strongly typed as we might like so for example there's an expression no less than is just if you haven't used it before just the operator you'd expect just comparing two things and it's going to return either true or false depending on the first argument is less than a second argument it's going to happen here againglasses on I can't see anything anybody Tas don't count they get their own candy yeah good question sounds like a reasonable guess right am I going to compare a string two number so see how good my name is not bad all right a good question sorry a good thought but in fact my younger son would say fudge knuckle yeah right this is a place I don't know about you John I think this is actually really not good because right what this is doing is it's allowing so let me back up and say it it's got an overload on the less than that allows you to compare basically the lexicographic ordering or this the sequence of ordering of symbols including numbers inside of the machine and this in my mind should have been an error I mean why in the world would you want to compare that just to give you an example of that for instanceright the number four is less than the string three whereas the string for is not less than the string three and this is a place where it's comparing strings and numbers in a strange way so why am i showing you this partly to show you that it's kind of weird but also to tell you that one of the things you want to do is exercise what I'm going to call some type discipline meaning when you write code what types of arguments are operands you apply to operators cuz this is something that could certainly have screwed you up if you didn't realize it did it and you need to have that discipline to make sure it's doing the right thingone of the other things you're going to see is that some of the operators have odd meanings and again I think we look because in case you didn't understand one of them is Remember The Operators do look at the types so division for example 9 / 5 is 1 because this is integer division that is it's the largest number of integer multiples of 5 and there would be a remainder associated with it which is in fact four and again you got to be careful about how you use the operators alright suppose I look at that expression 3 + 4 * 5 3 right now I think one is 235 cuz this could be 3 + 4 * 5 or it could be three plus four times five and of course you know when you look at code it doesn't pauseanybody know what happens in this case I'm going to try if I don't make it you know just get somebody to pass it oh I just hit somebody in the head thank you please pass it back to that guy if you want candy sit much closer down that way we can film you as well as we go along right so the point is there is something here called operator press basically things like exponentiation are done before you do multiplication or division which are done before you do things like addition and subtraction and so in fact if I wanted the other version of it in fact if I do this right is going to give me 23 because it does the multiplication first if I wanted the other version of it I need to tell it that by using excuse me in general what I would say is when in doubt
