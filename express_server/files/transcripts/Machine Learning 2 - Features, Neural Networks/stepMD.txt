## Training Loss and Weight Vector
- Training loss is the average over all examples in a training set of the loss of a particular example with respect to the weight vector.
- The goal is to find the single weight vector that minimizes the training loss in order to have low loss on average for all examples.

## Regression and Classification Loss Functions
- In regression, the loss function is based on the residual, which measures how much the model's prediction overshoots the true label.
- For classification, specifically binary classification, the margin is the key metric, representing the score multiplied by the label.
