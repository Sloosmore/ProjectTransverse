## True Objective of Machine Learning
2024-01-17T01:47:35.473Z
- Minimizing error on unseen future examples
- Learning about machines
- **Machine Learning Vocabulary**
    - *Gradient*: A vector that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of a function and whose magnitude is the slope of the function in that direction.
- The true objective is minimizing error on unseen future examples, rather than just minimizing error on the training set.
- Unsupervised learning will be discussed later.

## Training Loss as an Objective Function

- Switching gears to talk about unsupervised learning.
- Questioning whether training loss is a good objective function.
- The described algorithm suggests outputting the weight seen in the training set, indicating a need for objective functions beyond simply minimizing training loss.
