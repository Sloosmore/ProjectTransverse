## Machine Learning Review
2024-01-17T01:46:35.872Z
- Supervised learning involves feature extraction and learning algorithms
- Feature extraction converts examples into a feature vector
- Linear predictors or neural networks provide scores for the feature vectors
- Scores are defined via simple or more complex linear combinations
- Score functions can be used for classification and regression

## Back Propagation Example and K Nearest Neighbors
2024-01-17T01:46:35.872Z
- Back propagation exemplifies how neural networks update weights during training.
- K Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm used for classification and regression based on the proximity of data points.

## True Objective of Machine Learning
2024-01-17T01:47:35.473Z
- Minimizing error on unseen future examples
- Learning about machines
- **Machine Learning Vocabulary**
    - *Gradient*: A vector that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of a function and whose magnitude is the slope of the function in that direction.
- The true objective is minimizing error on unseen future examples, rather than just minimizing error on the training set.
- Unsupervised learning will be discussed later.
