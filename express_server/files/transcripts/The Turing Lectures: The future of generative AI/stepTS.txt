<2024-01-17T00:35:21.853Z> I'm finding real world like use cases and users research outfits and I'm really excited to be hosting this very special and I'm told sold out lecture for you today and it is the last in our series of 2023 lectures and the first ever hybrid during lecture discourse as we prepare and build up for the Christmas lecture3 now as it's become a bit of a tradition for the host of this years during lectures of hands who's been lecture before some people some people who's been to a lecture from this year's series before lecture today<2024-01-17T00:36:37.853Z> hey welcome to the ones have been hit for welcome back and just as a reminder that during lectures are the cheerings flagship lecture series they've been running since 2016 and welcome World leading experts in the domain of data science and AI to come and talk to you Institute itself we have had a quick video we are the National Institute for data science and AI we are named after Alan Turing who is one of the most prominent man very famous he is playing at ensuring and our mission is to make great leaps in data science and AI research to change the world for the better and as I mentioned today is not just the Turing lecture it is also a discourse which means two important things so firstly when I'm done with the intro the lights will go down quiet until exactly 7:30<2024-01-17T00:37:38.852Z> guys I will be happening and the lights are broken that's part of the program for today but also it is a discourse and we really want to get you guys involved if there's a huge Q&A section at the end for about 30 minutes please do think about what questions you'd like to ask our speaker today if you're in person we will have roaming mics that will be going around we can bring upstairs as well if you're online you can ask a question in the Vimeo chats and someone here will be checking the questions and we'll be able to share if you would like to share on social media that you're here and having an amazing evening please do tag us we are on Twitter X Twitter and we are on Instagram at the Turing instead please do take us to see what you're sharing and connect with you as well so this is lecture Series has been answering the question how a I broke the internet with a focus on generative AI you guys can basically think of generative<2024-01-17T00:39:06.853Z> can be text content like you see from chat GPT it could be images for wide range of things and potentially professionally for blog posts or emails your colleagues don't realize we've written by an algorithm and not by you if you've done that before if you're at school aggressively make the goose sillier and sillier until Jackie PT gave him the image of a crazy silly goose and said this is a silliest goose in the history of the Universe I did not think it is possible to get any more silly goose so obviously a wide range of applications from the technology if you guys want to look at that absolutely Mesmerizing the focus of this year<2024-01-17T00:40:27.859Z> the technology which basically leaves one final big question and answered which is we are here now but what is the future of generative Ai and that is the focus for this evening so that is pretty much it for the interview artificial intelligence as a scientific discipline has been with us since just after the second world war it began roughly speaking with the Advent of the first digital computers but I have to tell you that for most of the time until recently slow that started to change this century<2024-01-17T00:45:27.864Z> so how does it actually work how does it actually work well are the simplest way of getting machine learning to be able to do something is what's called supervised learning and supervised learning like all of machine learning requires what we call training data so in this case the train couple of Tesla drivers not quite sure whether they want to admit they own a Tesla we got a couple of Tesla drivers in the in the audience driving mode is only possible because of this technology it is this technology which is enabling a Tesla in full self driving mode<2024-01-17T00:48:44.857Z> Luca an animal brain or nervous system under a microscope and you'll find that it contains enormous numbers of nerve cells called neurons and those nerve cells are connected to one another in vast networks now we don't have precise figures but in a human brain the current estimate is something like 86 billion neurons in the human brain how they got to wait yeah then it becomes excited and it sends the signal to its neighbor now remember in the human brain there's something like that yes yes to be honest we don't really understanding
