but I'm going to start today by talking about so what have we been doing what are we actually done over the last few lectures and I'm going to suggest that what we've done is we've outlined a lot of the basic elements of programming a lot of the basic elements are going to need to write code and I want to just highlight it for you cuz we're going to come back and look at it so I'm going to suggest that we've looked at three different kinds of things we talked about data we've talked about operationstalked about commands or statements what we expect it's our way of representing fundamentally the kinds of information we want to move around and here I'm going to suggest we've seen numbers we've seen strings and I'm going to add booleans here as well there are third kind of value that we saw when we started talking about conditions we saw so we have operations things like addition and multiplication which we saw not only apply to numbers but we can use them on things like strings and we're going to come back to them again can't use them on booleans they have a different set of things they do things like and oror set another way branches of changing the flow of control through that the last thing we added were Luke mechanisms and here we saw wow the first example we've seen that's what we've done so far now interestingly this set of instructions is actually quite powerful we're going to come back to that later on in terms of what we can do with it but what we really done is given that basis we're now talking about how do we write Common patterns of code how do we write things a problem second thing we've been doing I want to highlight for you is we've along the way mostly just verbally rather than writing it down but we've been talking about Good Style good programming style things that we ought to do as you put these pieces together in order to give you really good code and you should be collecting those together give you some examples what are we talked about we talked about things like using comments to highlight what you're doing in the code to make it easier to debug we talked about type discipline the notion that you should check the types of operations before you play operators to them to make sure that they're what the code is expecting we talked about descriptive use of good variable names fourth one we talked about was this idea of testing all possible branches through a piece of code if it's got conditionals in it to make sure that every possible input is going to give you an output that you actually want to see so you know you can start writing your own kind of Miss Manners book if you like them you know what are good programming you know I don't know what you call good programming hygiene good programming style good programming practices things that you want to do to write good code okay we're going to do today is we're going to start now building up Beyond just these pieces although they're valuable to startpatterns of code that tackle certain classes of problems and secondly we're going to talk about tools you can use to help understand those pieces of things okay iterative programs and I want to generalize that for a second because we're going to come back and use this a lot and I want to do a very high level description first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to choose the variable that's going to count when the world do I mean by that I'm thinking about a problem I'm going to show you an example in a second first thing I'm going to do is say what is the thing that's going to change every time I run through the same set of code what is counting my way through this processwhat's the variable that I want to use second thing I do I need to initialize it and I need to initialize it outside of the loop it is where do I want to start and I need to make sure I have a command that up the third thing I want to do is I need to set up the Right End test how do I know when I'm done with the loop and obviously that auto involve the variable in some way or it's not going to make a lot of sense so this includes the variable since that's the thing that's changing all right the fourth thing I'm going to do this is actually somethingI want to remind you that block of code is a set of instructions the same set of instructions that are going to be done each time through the loop all is going to change is the value of the variable of the value of some data structures and remind you that inside of here I better be changing the variable that's counting is not changing I'm going to be stuck in an infinite Loop so right and then the last thing I want to do is just decide you know what do I do when I'm done okay I know it looks boring but it's a structure of the things I want to think about when I go through trying to take a problem and mapping it into an iterative program those are the things I want to see if I go along all right so let me give you an example
