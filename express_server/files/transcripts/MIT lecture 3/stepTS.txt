The lecture concluded with a hint at building upon the basics discussed previously, specifically mentioning patterns of code that tackle certain classes of problems and tools to aid in understanding those pieces of code. The lecturer indicated the intention to delve into iterative programs and emphasized the selection of variables for counting within a process. This approach was described as a high-level description intended for further elaboration and application in future discussions.<2024-01-15T05:25:24.748Z> what's the variable that I want to use second thing I do I need to initialize it and I need to initialize it outside of the loop it is where do I want to start and I need to make sure I have a command that up the third thing I want to do is I need to set up the Right End test how do I know when I'm done with the loop and obviously that auto involve the variable in some way or it's not going to make a lot of sense so this includes the variable since that's the thing that's changing all right the fourth thing I'm going to do this is actually something<2024-01-15T05:26:25.548Z> I want to remind you that block of code is a set of instructions the same set of instructions that are going to be done each time through the loop all is going to change is the value of the variable of the value of some data structures and remind you that inside of here I better be changing the variable that's counting is not changing I'm going to be stuck in an infinite Loop so right and then the last thing I want to do is just decide you know what do I do when I'm done okay I know it looks boring but it's a structure of the things I want to think about when I go through trying to take a problem and mapping it into an iterative program those are the things I want to see if I go along all right so let me give you an example
