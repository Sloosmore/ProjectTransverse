## Nomenclature 
2024-01-17T02:12:32.198Z
- **Noise:** A random variation that is added to the data, which impacts the accuracy of learning algorithms.

- The dataset consists of:
  - Features denoted by "m"
  - Targets denoted by "n"
- The instance of the dataset is denoted by a role with superscripts in parentheses. 
- In machine learning, managing numerous indices is essential, requiring a specific notation for clarity. 

## Regression and Approximation Problem
2024-01-17T02:13:57.000Z
- The basic problem is regression, aiming to find an approximation that depends on the feature vector and a certain number of parameters.
- The parameters are referred to as Theta in the context of general parameters and as weights in the case of a neural network.
- Approximation problem involves finding a function that approximates the target up to a certain error and involves minimizing this error.
- There is complex theory and decision-making involved in choosing the function class and type of function that can effectively model the problem.

## Dimensionality and Regression
2024-01-17T02:16:55.680Z
- **Dimensionality**: The number of dimensions, which has implications for computational complexity.
- The dimension of the problem can impact computational capability due to the curse of dimensionality.
- Regression involves choosing a model to approximate a problem, such as a neural network.

## Python Packages and Model Accuracy
2024-01-17T02:20:31.289Z
- Python packages can be used to assess model accuracy and avoid overfitting
- Choosing the right number of parameters and architecture is crucial for model performance
- Overfitting can be a challenge, especially with complex models like GPT

## Linear Regression
2024-01-17T02:21:20.052Z
- Model represented by the function y = b₀ + b₁x
- Chooses a linear relationship between the input and output variables

- Overfitting: The modeling error which occurs when a function is too closely fit to a limited set of data points, and then makes poor predictions about other data
- Parameters: Variables in the function representing the slope and the y-intercept

## Choosing a Model for Approximation
2024-01-17T02:23:04.536Z
