- **Euclidean distance**: Distance measured in a straight line between two points in Euclidean space.
- Distance in machine learning can be challenging to define, especially in cases like determining the distance between two customers or two movies.
- The measure of distance is a crucial factor in the training of networks, as it is used to minimize the error between the function and the target.

- In classification problems, measuring distance can be more complex, requiring consideration of probabilities.
- The topic of distance measurement is fundamental and encompasses a field called Measure Theory, a branch of mathematics focused on the measurement of distances between sets, which includes concepts of integrals.
