and what we saw as expressions are formed of operands and operators in the simple things we did were the the sort of things you'd expect from numerical things now I want to stress one other Nuance here which isn't going to do some examples of this initially we just typed in Expressions Into The Interpreter that is directly into Python and as I suggested last time the interpreters actually a program inside of the machine that is basically following the rules were describing here to deduce the value and print it up and if we type directly into The Interpreter it essentially doesn't a valve in a printit's kind of Prince most of the time we're going to be doing Expressions inside of some piece of code inside of a script which is the python word for program and there I want to make this distinction this Nuance the evaluator is still going to be taking those expressions and using its rules to get a value why because typically you're doing that to use it somewhere else in the program there's no print unless we make it explicit and that's a little bit down in the weeds it's a detail but one I want to stress you need if you want something to be printed out inside of your code you need to tell the machine to do that okay so let's do some simple examples we've already seen some ideas I just want to remind you if I want to for example type in an expression like that notice the syntactical form it's an expression of course I get out the value I'd like there yes sir
