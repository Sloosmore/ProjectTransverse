## Discussion on Natural Language Processing

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) - a field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.
- Importance of standardizing text - converting all text to lowercase can help in simplifying the processing of data and reduce the variations due to upper/lower case.

## Data Preprocessing and Text Analysis

- Word Stemming - the process of reducing words to their root forms, such as converting "stacking" to "stack" and "stacked" to "stack," to facilitate analysis.
- Handling synonyms - discussing the transformation of similar words to a common representation, e.g., "courteous" and "cordial" both being transformed to "polite," for more consistent analysis.
- Removal of rare words - considering the insignificance of words occurring very infrequently, also referred to as outliers, to ensure meaningful and relevant data analysis.

## Creation of Frequency Matrix

- Creation of a frequency matrix - a tabular representation showing the occurrences of specific words (e.g., "great," "terrible") in the dataset, aiding in data summarization and analysis.
- Decisions based on word frequencies - using the frequency data to make decisions, such as understanding trends, progress, and changes over time based on the occurrences of certain terms.

## Utilizing data for decision making

- Decision-making based on data - leveraging the processed data to make informed decisions, possibly on a regular basis, to assess progress, trends, and changes in specific terms and overall data analysis.
