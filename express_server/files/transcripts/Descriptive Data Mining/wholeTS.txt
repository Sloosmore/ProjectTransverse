but when you have no idea what might be out there answers that from a business point of the house they need to stay the money and see what the computer we're going to talk about okay what is data mining and it's just yeah how do we deal with the data that we have how can we computers to a computer everything is a number right so if you have numbers it's easy if you have text not so easy right so we're going to talk about some ways to actually turn text into numbers such that we can do daily life and then you have assignment grade you guys got money off so you got to put it to work somehow right don't forget quickly right 6967 all right the concept of data mining has existed for a long time but the problem is up until the last 10 15 20 years we didn't actually have the data that would allow us to do anything it was the experts would go you know they look in their crystal ball all kinds of pain and say this is what we should do I can see I've been reading the news this is what we should do now right you guys may enter right now some of you apply for internships there's a lot of companies now to do freshman internships because for the companies it's a try and buy they want to see if you would make a good employee and it's never too early to enter do you get an idea as to work professional work is why right so here it is anything you do on a computer that is connected to the internet is being stored at Sea right my wife was not online right all of those clicks even mentioned a little bit of this last week even the time if you're on the same website the time betweenshow interest rate period I'll get arrested are you in that thing that's on Twitter it's news or whether it's something you might consider purchasing or you're just reading so in company that you might work for me they're not recording all of that stuff they are losing because right now the way companies win is to get the most value out of data which is why bring me do you guys second ways to analyze and argue right then that Ted Talk the last two things and lies with data argue with data if you want to be successful wherever you go right so you have to play with baby okay so everything's being recorded so big David that's what allows data money there's enough data right A lot of it is probably not but it's like mining for gold and mining for whatever find that pain right you find the good thing and that's what date of mine is about all right but observation we talked about this last it's a road of data right think of a spreadsheet right so our roads and observation we can do learning right supervised learning says we know what the answer is we humans know what the answer is so we train a computer algorithm right in the machine learning algorithm of some sort whatever will actually leave the last two weeks of the class all include issues do it exclamation point and so we can correct the computer so if the answer is X and it comes up with Y and we can tell the address cuz we know what the answer is right but in some cases we don't know what the answer is so we can't tell the computer what the right answer is cuz we do not know what the right answer is and so on this chapter of this particular book the authors focus on unsupervised learning period what kind of machine learning algorithm or an analytic algorithm teach us show us that we would not have thought of for it I gave you the example last week of the beer and diapers at Costco that's a day of learning I go home interesting with the thought of that rightthe algorithm came up with and then we could go right as humans we get a team to get a person whatever that makes sense and it may or may not is it good or is it maybe such a small thing that it's not going to make enough of a difference to the business so we thought qualitative assessments right not numbers surveys for qualitative how do you feel today I know some of you are probably in Denver right maybe all of you on some of you probably got out of debt was Professor did he goes right now I don't think he doesn't every day but he does do it some days like thatnow who's giving the number higher than you actually thought we have a free person please who's actually given a loan number for sympathy just because nobody nobody wants him to be all right so two ways we're going to talk about to do daily money there are more than but clustering of similarity we can have a computer let's actually reports as well and then Association rules rules all right so cluster analysis similar groups could also be disciplined groups right so this is the data prep so we haven't done an analysis yet we have a bunch of datawhat we're going to do is have the computer group The data what kind of groups did it comes up because we can use the grouping to go out there's some significance and how your computer decided to get everything together but we're going to talk about it question mark everybody can find something from Amazon not bought something from Amazon in the last week I got a few are you planning on buying something this week are you making something else all right so Market the market is right good we send email to all right how do we measure similarity how do we knowhow can a computer figure out what similar to something else maybe everything to a computer's numbers so it has to be nothing but computer will compare numbers most similar are most similar I got to be numerical your computer to be able to do something now we'll talk about texts later okay and then of course distance between two points so I can have a two sets of numbers we're going to do a little example here age and income pair so think of age on one axis income on another axis I have an age value and an income value for two different people right X and yep we can have three or four or five values doesn't matter to the computer it can still take because a little hard to seeorganized also talked about this last week Wednesday the difference in range of values the age versus income income is in tens of Millions age maybe up so if you imagine age and income on a two-dimensional axis and the scale so the income value is going to dominate the distance right cuz we're talking about tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars potentially difference and income versus decades difference in age and so that's where again z-scores we essentially take it down to standard deviation distance from the mean right that's a standard deviationthat fixes the scale issue so here's a leak right if you want to dig more into z-scores all right the distance the square root of the sub traction ? cost me about 5 cents per hour why Square first for each of these terms yesterday Monday yes people they're getting rid of the negative stuff day one picture somebody's 23 we're going to call that observation you and they make $20,375 I certainly hope when you guys graduate you were making more $20,375 I'm not even sure so the average ear is 2000 hours and so that's like 10 bucks an hourat least if you work in California you'll get it and then we have another one actually they're 36 so we can compute the distance between them right now which is a big distance and that's because I think this is almost a thousand maybe it's 900 East Square 900 if you get 81, 000 for that as opposed to 13 which is 169 so this is why Z scores this term dominates the distance equation which can slant the information that we from those analysis right but there is income dominance so if we do Z scores we get these valuesnotice they're all around right because this is essentially standard deviation distance from the knee but now until using the z-score values we get a distance of just under one and now if we do lots of these but we're talking about clustering analysis and how do we find things that are closest now it's going to be more equitable all right so categorical data so this is text but not freeform also talked about this Wednesday this is like gender male female oven right for housing any of those bigger categories you would like that that's okay right we can turn those categories into numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5floating Point numbers like pagef like David bucks for income East numbers 0 1 2 3 124 whatever the distance has no because I just assigning the number so so you need to be Alyssa's when you have categorical data that you have turned into numbers which SPSS all right so hierarchical clustering we take every day to point and we start comparing them to essentially the nearest neighbor so we build up clusters from the ground up we start within data points and I start taking hairs of data points that are closer togetherand then I compare those to the next closest poster up to to make posters at 3:00 or 4:00 and so we end up creating clusters on the ground up right a lot of ways to do this all right another way is Katie's okay means is K is how many clusters we so we're I want three clusters es and five clusters I bought so and we may do this more than once you can try it without or three it's right or five and see what comes out so the K is US telling the algorithm how many clusters we want formed and what they do is they start off so you can see where the X's are the computer has just randomly chosen an observation and his computing the average distance from the points around itRaymond we don't know where the closer should be and so you can see here in the second iteration the computer has chosen a different three means like this is I mean and then it starts Computing right so it is yeah it's even evolved a little bit here but you can see so K means we sent three questions okay it takes three observation three means animations because we want three plus and then files is set of observations closest to that mean and it keeps iteration iterating until nothing changes so it can take a while with game namesquestions thoughts which one should you use hierarchical of all the ways that you can do hierarchical flustering or came out if you don't have much data you need to get hierarchical because you're building up clusters from size one every day the point every observation is clusters how many clusters do you end up with in a heart or you don't get to choose I came in as we get started outliers I have a data point way off to one side or the other which will which can mess up a hierarchical clustering like where does it go it's far enough out that maybe it's distance is about the same for where you put it right where's the other roomare you going to have problems with that and if you remove outliers then that can make a big difference in how they prior to compostering goes right if you have a lot of data right so hierarchical clustering it's not good for a lot of data you have thousands of data points they're starting from 10,000 years if you have a nice idea as how many groups how many costs are then tell the other question and then of course binary data like Fiesta true false we can turn that into 0112 but a distance doesn't make sense for right or no is essentially categorical we've turned categorical data in the numbers now there's over 1 2 so with this kind of databecause the distance doesn't make sense questions thoughts have income tax but we are having a chance right now this might be a good slide to remember for an exam because you know it's one thing to say you know blah blah blah but another is here's a case would you use hierarchical clustering or KDS when you give him so all right now is we're looking for an answer people are buying and involved right like oh we sold millions of this thousands of that so what do you order more right we ordered more so that's an easy one but like the beer and diapers they go want our people attending together because if we can find some then and maybe sales will gotogether right so we don't know what it is so we do data mining but it comes up here right now let's move the diapers here has to be cooked so this is daylight we don't actually know what the answer is period so period specific thing to Costco did it's called a paired analysis they were looking for two things that were most similar back together on the weekend so when you don't know the answer that's when we do something like this we're trying to see what goes together this is the cluster analysis so the question would be right so it's going to say oh there's X number of observations right if it's less than 500 then you probably want to say but if it's thousands tens of thousands millions of observations hierarchical will take way too long right and so then you go out pay means and how many clusters do you want probably wouldn't ask but we're human probably no more than 10 I mean how many groups make sense that actuallyyou do pay me into multiple times you can take out three clusters see what you come up with then you do four or seven or 10 to see what you come up with and then you start the analysis right so so this is a technique to analyze data right arguing with data is the brain power you put after you get the results so what do these clusters mean what what is similar between them because the computer saying they're similar yes SPSS to the rescue yes SPSS will do this all you got to do is throw the date and go analyze I'm saying okay how many clusters do you wantwe don't have to do the computation anymore the tools are are great so you will not be asked to do the computational it will be more of a thought exercise this is what the computer gave you what does that mean right or what decision would you make based on the results of what the computer game good questions anybody else or we do clustering of and it could really make sense Association rules daily Behavior if they spend x amount of time on this page then the probability that they will buy is what right kind of thing remember every time you're in the internet app on your phone it's being recorded everything you do is being recorded at least my companies don't know what they're doing and of course that information is being sold without our permission which the government May finally get around to change the Cameo and management think of all of the apps and we all have all of the websitesparagraphs and you know so on and so forth but how do we turn that into numbers because everything to a computer is a number and as a panelists somebody goes oh I want you to analyze our social media account find out what the company and there's thousands of element we still call right so there can be good information in there but how do we take it out right how do we make sense right unstructured as I've already said breaking news relies requested that we call our tweets exes now so he must I guess Elon Musk came upso what do we call a former spouse please get an email I don't see strong Joe's no I'm telling him that my failsafe works Freeport touch right how do we turn this into numbers so the computer can do something with it I say leave but how can you tell the computer to turn this into numbers so that some kind of analysis can be used it's an issue but if you and as we're going to find out you know like the word my my okay there are words that matter to an analysis and there were two in analysis if we're going to turn this into a set of numbers we need to get rid of the things that don't matter right so there's bothwe have to structure right it's got to be something we can plug into SPSS Rosen Collins or equivalent s crazy so here it is a term document Matrix we pick out what we think are the important words and tell the computer here's the set of words right so we can go back to this we can look at a subset of the day that we have and we humans can pick out words we think are important and then we tell the computer here's the important words how long you do is zero means so each row here is a reply from someone in the survey and it's an observation that's hero means that word is not show up in that observation I don't mean that that word did show up in that observationthen you can look mothers the word flight showed up four times in our 10 cents the delayed only showed up too you can see delayed flight actually shows out right two out of 10 right next 20% and so so now we have numbers from words all right so we can now do clustering because we have numbers which words showed up together will do okay means won't help my article I have three clusters what's going on here we go I've got a custard 156 right horrible service the purpose issues okay 24810 seat issues thank youand then 379 scheduling issues flight right that's the delayed play although here they had flight who knows we have to go back actually let's get back flight was canceled okay so now we go look we have three sets of things we should probably work on as a company so we can assign a team to each we can turn text into numbers tokenization this is every word is a token to do tokenization as it among this right we have to get rid of periods Thomas anything that's not a word they have to get rid of well when we do that we're going to just like and a lotwhatever so we need to get rid of that make everything lowercase so we don't have to worry about upper lower case right a word is the word and then right here this is what a lot of people don't think is word ending right in this case stacking stacked until their algorithm s I'll pick it actually do this and then the last one right so this is the bridge maybe it's on the next one yeah is words like courteous cordial life as one thing so we can actually change our essentially synonyms or very close to being synonyms of each other and so we actually haveeverything in the computer program that says oh all of these words are actually this would be polite so courteous becomes flight cordial becomes polite you know or mad angry unhappy I'll become angry right words that rarely happen even if we tell the computer these are important words you know if I've got you know if I'm looking at a thousand and I have a word I've identified as important cuz we do this first right before we run the computer out and say Here's the important words and it turns out out of these 1,000 X's formerly known as streets right I have a word one of my important words comes up once or twiceprobably should be ignored right it's so rare it probably has no very it's like an outlier and of course with outlier you have to do anything that's another amount and then of course you know we have to get rid of all those like and so here right we can now make a turn frequency Matrix once we've done all this we got rid of the connectors and is of right all of that maybe we got rid of the important what we wear and now we can get a charge that says how many times does the word great or the word terrible in this case show up at an observationanother way to summarize the data you know and we will add these out and do I have more grades or more Terribles is it about the same of course then so this can lead to a decision is and hasn't changed over time maybe we do this every week every month every year is probably a little too slow are we getting better right are you getting more grades are we getting more terrible but of course this is just two terms right we can have 10 or 20 terms that we're looking at and what's the the change What's the progress so that's where the decision making it's day to dream we have some data now we can make decisions
