One such instance was the venture with my brother in 2019, where we aimed to create a company focused on happiness and actualization.\n\n### Misalignment of Purpose: Lessons from Pat and Joy\n- Despite our noble intentions of spreading happiness, the divergence between our personal needs and the startup's offerings became evident as the platform aimed at life coaches and therapists felt incongruent with our own aspirations.\n\n### Selecting the Right Industry: Immersion and Understanding\n- An essential step when starting up is delving deep into the industry of choice, understanding its intricacies, and identifying potential inefficiencies. By immersing oneself in the industry, new perspectives and opportunities begin to emerge, often where the seasoned individuals may overlook potential innovations.\n\n- The analogy of learning about the cleaning industry serves as a testament to the significance of detailed industry immersion. Just as in basketball, merely reading about cleaning won't make someone proficient at it; similarly, true insight is gained through hands-on and intensive learning.\n\nIn the realm of startups, each misstep serves as a building block for future success, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal passions with the startup's vision and immersing oneself in the chosen industry to identify novel opportunities.",

One such instance was the venture with my brother in 2019, where we aimed to create a company focused on happiness and actualization.\n\n### Misalignment of Purpose: Lessons from Pat and Joy\n- Despite our noble intentions of spreading happiness, the divergence between our personal needs and the startup's offerings became evident as the platform aimed at life coaches and therapists felt incongruent with our own aspirations.\n\n### Selecting the Right Industry: Immersion and Understanding\n- An essential step when starting up is delving deep into the industry of choice, understanding its intricacies, and identifying potential inefficiencies. By immersing oneself in the industry, new perspectives and opportunities begin to emerge, often where the seasoned individuals may overlook potential innovations.\n\n- The analogy of learning about the cleaning industry serves as a testament to the significance of detailed industry immersion. Just as in basketball, merely reading about cleaning won't make someone proficient at it; similarly, true insight is gained through hands-on and intensive learning.\n\nIn the realm of startups, each misstep serves as a building block for future success, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal passions with the startup's vision and immersing oneself in the chosen industry to identify novel opportunities.",

One such instance was the venture with my brother in 2019, where we aimed to create a company focused on happiness and actualization.\n\n### Misalignment of Purpose: Lessons from Pat and Joy\n- Despite our noble intentions of spreading happiness, the divergence between our personal needs and the startup's offerings became evident as the platform aimed at life coaches and therapists felt incongruent with our own aspirations.\n\n### Selecting the Right Industry: Immersion and Understanding\n- An essential step when starting up is delving deep into the industry of choice, understanding its intricacies, and identifying potential inefficiencies. By immersing oneself in the industry, new perspectives and opportunities begin to emerge, often where the seasoned individuals may overlook potential innovations.\n\n- The analogy of learning about the cleaning industry serves as a testament to the significance of detailed industry immersion. Just as in basketball, merely reading about cleaning won't make someone proficient at it; similarly, true insight is gained through hands-on and intensive learning.\n\nIn the realm of startups, each misstep serves as a building block for future success, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal passions with the startup's vision and immersing oneself in the chosen industry to identify novel opportunities.",

One such instance was the venture with my brother in 2019, where we aimed to create a company focused on happiness and actualization.\n\n### Misalignment of Purpose: Lessons from Pat and Joy\n- Despite our noble intentions of spreading happiness, the divergence between our personal needs and the startup's offerings became evident as the platform aimed at life coaches and therapists felt incongruent with our own aspirations.\n\n### Selecting the Right Industry: Immersion and Understanding\n- An essential step when starting up is delving deep into the industry of choice, understanding its intricacies, and identifying potential inefficiencies. By immersing oneself in the industry, new perspectives and opportunities begin to emerge, often where the seasoned individuals may overlook potential innovations.\n\n- The analogy of learning about the cleaning industry serves as a testament to the significance of detailed industry immersion. Just as in basketball, merely reading about cleaning won't make someone proficient at it; similarly, true insight is gained through hands-on and intensive learning.\n\nIn the realm of startups, each misstep serves as a building block for future success, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal passions with the startup's vision and immersing oneself in the chosen industry to identify novel opportunities.",

This approach often leads to a lack of essential feedback, resulting in a product that doesn't address genuine needs and fails to retain user interest, culminating in a demotivating cycle of disenchantment and abandonment.\n\n- Drawing from personal experiences, the absence of meaningful feedback and iterative development during the early stages often leads to the eventual fade-out of the product, culminating in a sense of unfulfillment.\n\nIn the world of startups, recognizing the significance of dedicated, focused time coupled with embracing iterative feedback and development cycles is pivotal in steering clear of the pitfalls of isolated innovation and fostering sustainable product growth.",

One such instance was the venture with my brother in 2019, where we aimed to create a company focused on happiness and actualization.\n\n### Misalignment of Purpose: Lessons from Pat and Joy\n- Despite our noble intentions of spreading happiness, the divergence between our personal needs and the startup's offerings became evident as the platform aimed at life coaches and therapists felt incongruent with our own aspirations.\n\n### Selecting the Right Industry: Immersion and Understanding\n- An essential step when starting up is delving deep into the industry of choice, understanding its intricacies, and identifying potential inefficiencies. By immersing oneself in the industry, new perspectives and opportunities begin to emerge, often where the seasoned individuals may overlook potential innovations.\n\n- The analogy of learning about the cleaning industry serves as a testament to the significance of detailed industry immersion. Just as in basketball, merely reading about cleaning won't make someone proficient at it; similarly, true insight is gained through hands-on and intensive learning.\n\nIn the realm of startups, each misstep serves as a building block for future success, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal passions with the startup's vision and immersing oneself in the chosen industry to identify novel opportunities.",

This approach often leads to a lack of essential feedback, resulting in a product that doesn't address genuine needs and fails to retain user interest, culminating in a demotivating cycle of disenchantment and abandonment.\n\n- Drawing from personal experiences, the absence of meaningful feedback and iterative development during the early stages often leads to the eventual fade-out of the product, culminating in a sense of unfulfillment.\n\nIn the world of startups, recognizing the significance of dedicated, focused time coupled with embracing iterative feedback and development cycles is pivotal in steering clear of the pitfalls of isolated innovation and fostering sustainable product growth.",

One such instance was the venture with my brother in 2019, where we aimed to create a company focused on happiness and actualization.\n\n### Misalignment of Purpose: Lessons from Pat and Joy\n- Despite our noble intentions of spreading happiness, the divergence between our personal needs and the startup's offerings became evident as the platform aimed at life coaches and therapists felt incongruent with our own aspirations.\n\n### Selecting the Right Industry: Immersion and Understanding\n- An essential step when starting up is delving deep into the industry of choice, understanding its intricacies, and identifying potential inefficiencies. By immersing oneself in the industry, new perspectives and opportunities begin to emerge, often where the seasoned individuals may overlook potential innovations.\n\n- The analogy of learning about the cleaning industry serves as a testament to the significance of detailed industry immersion. Just as in basketball, merely reading about cleaning won't make someone proficient at it; similarly, true insight is gained through hands-on and intensive learning.\n\nIn the realm of startups, each misstep serves as a building block for future success, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal passions with the startup's vision and immersing oneself in the chosen industry to identify novel opportunities.",

              "value": "what the idea is really something like what is the actual problem and so there's a problem relate to me am I really passionate about that problem and then you should think okay with that I have this really great idea about it I'm going to people and then I'm going to watch it on you know I'm going to talk what really happened because he did not get you know maybe you'll get a lot of people with your site but no one sticks around because you didn't understand me back and then you know if you you know looking up you have some money in the bank you might go buy some users but sort of it just widdles out over town end up with the next thing is you should really think about what the the is released you should be able to start in one second and then you should thank you one of the biggest mistakes I've made is you know we started my coconut and I lose my brother and I started a company called pathjoy and in 9 2010 and our goal was basically to you know we have two bowls of mine one is to create the company that made people really happy and and and break something I was very very impactful so far okay and being you know we came up with his therapist so it seemed kind of obviously just creative platforms related pictures of therapist and what happened as a result though was that you know when we started you know sort of useless to us and so it wasn't even a problem you know almost a year trying to do this and so if you just start you know from people here to sleep think about this doing something you don't want to do so say you have you're able to State it where do you think of solutions so the first thing you should do is think of what the industry that you are getting yourself into whether it's big whether it's huge that and there's a number of ways to do this one is you know to really become a copy that industry for a little bit and so it might seem low kind of intuitive to do this because most people say you know if you really want to disrupt an industry you should really not be the no player in it you shouldn't you know someone who spent 20 or 30 years and in history probably because inefficiencies are on our other things that you can want to stop a new like coming into the industry you really should take you one or two months is really understanding what all the little bits and pieces of Industry are and how it works because it's when you get into the detail that's when you start seeing things you can exploit things you can really hit things that are really really beneficial you know people and so an example of this is you know when we start our phone doing we we decided to go we started with the cleaning industry and when we started you know we just were cleaners ourselves and we started playing houses and we found a really quickly was that we were very back there and so as a result you know we said that we don't learn more about this and we went to my book and what books about how to clean which helped me a little bit we learn a little bit more about cleaning supplies but it's sort of like that basketball you know you can watch and you can learn or you can watch and read about vegetables but you're not going to give you better at it if you don't actually do training you know throw basketball around and so we decided one of us basically have to go and learn how to clean and so we went to get trained by you know a professional training program that existed and that meant we actually went to get a job at a cleaning company itself and the cool thing was that you know I learned how to clean from you know training for the few weeks I was there at the cleaning company but even better thing was that I learned a lot about happening company works and in that sense you know I learned why local cleaning company could not become huge like from Joy is today and that's because they have you know they're pretty old school and they had a lot of things just just from anywhere from booking the customer to optimizing the cleaner schedules it was just done very efficiently there's so when you go if you are situation like mine where you know there's a service there's a service element of it you should go and do that service yourself you'll be at work if your thing is going to restaurant you should become aware if if you know painting you know become a painter and kind of getting the shoes of your customers from all angles of what you're trying to build the only thing is there's also a little subscription should be so obsessed to know like what everybody needs to make is doing and it seems like you know all the potential competitors or similar types of companies Google searching it and clicking on every single link and reading every single article from one from like search results and I I found all potential competitors big and small and if they're public I would go read their sons I would go I'll go read all their quarterly financials I would you know sit on the earnings calls you know most of these you'll get more chocolate but they're just these golden nuggets that you'll find once in awhile and you you won't be able to find that unless you actually go through the work of you know getting all of that information in your head so yeah it should become an expert in history now there should be no doubt when you're building this that you are the expert so that people would trust you when you're building this product the second thing is identifying customer segments so you know ideally at the end of the day in the end game you've built a product or business that everybody in the world is using but realistically in the beginning you kind of want to corner off a certain part of the customer base so that you can really optimize for them and that's just you know it's just a matter of focus in a matter of you know just you know whether it's 80 year old teenage girls or whatever it's you know soccer moms it was just be able to you know like say focus a lot on on their needs before you even create a product for you a code down you should really sort of worry about the ideal user experience of how your how you're going to solve the problem and that and that's not just me you know the website itself it's meaning you know how does the customer find out about you know whether it's you know give me an ad or through word of mouth or whatever so they find out about you they come to your site they learn more about you what's all that text say what are you communicating to them to the actual when they sign up for the product so they purchase the service what are they actually getting to after they finish using the product or actually finishes in the service you know there's they're sort of like an evaluation reviews and then put it down a paper and then put it into code and then from there so you have all these ideas in your head Now you kind of know what the core customer base and they just go out with a feature and with the whole user experience a very beginning like is what so no viable products you need to know what is the smallest feature set that you should build to solve the problem that you're trying to solve ved and I think if you go through the whole storyboard experience you can kind of figure out that period we called her to get meet and the second thing is before you put in things in front of the user you should really have your product as simple and a party positioning now and what my what I mean by that is that you know you should be able to go to you know a person and you should be able to say Hey you know this the X Y and me within a sentence and so for example you know at home enjoy it we started off with something actually super complicated like we're in and you can choose new blah blah blah blah and it just went off work Airgas and paragraphs when we present we went to you know potentially users to come on our phone they just get come and get bored after that first first two sentences and so functional benefit of what you do you know in the future when you're trying to build a brand and what night you should you should do you describe so we simply not to change our position ing temper ate so you have a MVP going out there now how do you get your first few years to start trying it so your first person should be you know obvious people the people that you're connected with you should use it obviously a union co-founder to be using it your Mom and Dad should be using it your friends and coworkers should be using it beyond that you want to get more user feedback and so you do okay local community so if you're building consumer products you know they're not influential local community mailing lists especially those for you know parents so those are places you might want to hit up to so when you go to wait we actually try all of these Weezer or something else fine I mean we're on planners so that was pretty easy and then our parents live in Milwaukee so we were basically so that I had to work friends and coworkers are kind of like in San Francisco and elsewhere do you have to pay me to use it dead end of not being able to convince many people to use this from the beginning so what we did was because we're Mountain View some of you guys might know cast retreat they have street fairs there during the summertime and so it go out and basically Chase on people and try to get from the f****** cleaning and almost everyone would say no until one day we took advantage you know it was a very hot and humid day and what we noticed was you know and this is like an any fear people you know there might be arts and crafts and things like that but everybody gravitates towards the food and drink area especially on a hot day so what we did was okay we didn't we figure we need to get in the middle of that and by again in the middle of that we just took water bottles Frozen and then we started hanging out free Free bottles of water we I think we basically Guilt Trip people into looking cleanings but the proof of pudding was that I figured most of the people were Guilt Trip into doing it but when they went home they didn't cancel on us well some of them did but a majority of them did not and so we felt like I thought okay that's good but at least you know there's something we're actually solving here so and you know I don't suggest I think lately they were selling shipping type products we're trying to replace shipping products for the mailing stuff and so they would show up to the US postal office and just like find people who are trying to ship products and just take them out of wine and try to get them lose your product and have some s*** because we're people are really show up and you know your conversion rate is going to be really really low but to go from zero to one to three to four these are kind of things you might have to do what do you do with all these users \n\n -60:-37\n",

              "value": "what the idea is really something like what is the actual problem and so there's a problem relate to me am I really passionate about that problem and then you should think okay with that I have this really great idea about it I'm going to people and then I'm going to watch it on you know I'm going to talk what really happened because he did not get you know maybe you'll get a lot of people with your site but no one sticks around because you didn't understand me back and then you know if you you know looking up you have some money in the bank you might go buy some users but sort of it just widdles out over town end up with the next thing is you should really think about what the the is released you should be able to start in one second and then you should thank you one of the biggest mistakes I've made is you know we started my coconut and I lose my brother and I started a company called pathjoy and in 9 2010 and our goal was basically to you know we have two bowls of mine one is to create the company that made people really happy and and and break something I was very very impactful so far okay and being you know we came up with his therapist so it seemed kind of obviously just creative platforms related pictures of therapist and what happened as a result though was that you know when we started you know sort of useless to us and so it wasn't even a problem you know almost a year trying to do this and so if you just start you know from people here to sleep think about this doing something you don't want to do so say you have you're able to State it where do you think of solutions so the first thing you should do is think of what the industry that you are getting yourself into whether it's big whether it's huge that and there's a number of ways to do this one is you know to really become a copy that industry for a little bit and so it might seem low kind of intuitive to do this because most people say you know if you really want to disrupt an industry you should really not be the no player in it you shouldn't you know someone who spent 20 or 30 years and in history probably because inefficiencies are on our other things that you can want to stop a new like coming into the industry you really should take you one or two months is really understanding what all the little bits and pieces of Industry are and how it works because it's when you get into the detail that's when you start seeing things you can exploit things you can really hit things that are really really beneficial you know people and so an example of this is you know when we start our phone doing we we decided to go we started with the cleaning industry and when we started you know we just were cleaners ourselves and we started playing houses and we found a really quickly was that we were very back there and so as a result you know we said that we don't learn more about this and we went to my book and what books about how to clean which helped me a little bit we learn a little bit more about cleaning supplies but it's sort of like that basketball you know you can watch and you can learn or you can watch and read about vegetables but you're not going to give you better at it if you don't actually do training you know throw basketball around and so we decided one of us basically have to go and learn how to clean and so we went to get trained by you know a professional training program that existed and that meant we actually went to get a job at a cleaning company itself and the cool thing was that you know I learned how to clean from you know training for the few weeks I was there at the cleaning company but even better thing was that I learned a lot about happening company works and in that sense you know I learned why local cleaning company could not become huge like from Joy is today and that's because they have you know they're pretty old school and they had a lot of things just just from anywhere from booking the customer to optimizing the cleaner schedules it was just done very efficiently there's so when you go if you are situation like mine where you know there's a service there's a service element of it you should go and do that service yourself you'll be at work if your thing is going to restaurant you should become aware if if you know painting you know become a painter and kind of getting the shoes of your customers from all angles of what you're trying to build the only thing is there's also a little subscription should be so obsessed to know like what everybody needs to make is doing and it seems like you know all the potential competitors or similar types of companies Google searching it and clicking on every single link and reading every single article from one from like search results and I I found all potential competitors big and small and if they're public I would go read their sons I would go I'll go read all their quarterly financials I would you know sit on the earnings calls you know most of these you'll get more chocolate but they're just these golden nuggets that you'll find once in awhile and you you won't be able to find that unless you actually go through the work of you know getting all of that information in your head so yeah it should become an expert in history now there should be no doubt when you're building this that you are the expert so that people would trust you when you're building this product the second thing is identifying customer segments so you know ideally at the end of the day in the end game you've built a product or business that everybody in the world is using but realistically in the beginning you kind of want to corner off a certain part of the customer base so that you can really optimize for them and that's just you know it's just a matter of focus in a matter of you know just you know whether it's 80 year old teenage girls or whatever it's you know soccer moms it was just be able to you know like say focus a lot on on their needs before you even create a product for you a code down you should really sort of worry about the ideal user experience of how your how you're going to solve the problem and that and that's not just me you know the website itself it's meaning you know how does the customer find out about you know whether it's you know give me an ad or through word of mouth or whatever so they find out about you they come to your site they learn more about you what's all that text say what are you communicating to them to the actual when they sign up for the product so they purchase the service what are they actually getting to after they finish using the product or actually finishes in the service you know there's they're sort of like an evaluation reviews and then put it down a paper and then put it into code and then from there so you have all these ideas in your head Now you kind of know what the core customer base and they just go out with a feature and with the whole user experience a very beginning like is what so no viable products you need to know what is the smallest feature set that you should build to solve the problem that you're trying to solve ved and I think if you go through the whole storyboard experience you can kind of figure out that period we called her to get meet and the second thing is before you put in things in front of the user you should really have your product as simple and a party positioning now and what my what I mean by that is that you know you should be able to go to you know a person and you should be able to say Hey you know this the X Y and me within a sentence and so for example you know at home enjoy it we started off with something actually super complicated like we're in and you can choose new blah blah blah blah and it just went off work Airgas and paragraphs when we present we went to you know potentially users to come on our phone they just get come and get bored after that first first two sentences and so functional benefit of what you do you know in the future when you're trying to build a brand and what night you should you should do you describe so we simply not to change our position ing temper ate so you have a MVP going out there now how do you get your first few years to start trying it so your first person should be you know obvious people the people that you're connected with you should use it obviously a union co-founder to be using it your Mom and Dad should be using it your friends and coworkers should be using it beyond that you want to get more user feedback and so you do okay local community so if you're building consumer products you know they're not influential local community mailing lists especially those for you know parents so those are places you might want to hit up to so when you go to wait we actually try all of these Weezer or something else fine I mean we're on planners so that was pretty easy and then our parents live in Milwaukee so we were basically so that I had to work friends and coworkers are kind of like in San Francisco and elsewhere do you have to pay me to use it dead end of not being able to convince many people to use this from the beginning so what we did was because we're Mountain View some of you guys might know cast retreat they have street fairs there during the summertime and so it go out and basically Chase on people and try to get from the f****** cleaning and almost everyone would say no until one day we took advantage you know it was a very hot and humid day and what we noticed was you know and this is like an any fear people you know there might be arts and crafts and things like that but everybody gravitates towards the food and drink area especially on a hot day so what we did was okay we didn't we figure we need to get in the middle of that and by again in the middle of that we just took water bottles Frozen and then we started hanging out free Free bottles of water we I think we basically Guilt Trip people into looking cleanings but the proof of pudding was that I figured most of the people were Guilt Trip into doing it but when they went home they didn't cancel on us well some of them did but a majority of them did not and so we felt like I thought okay that's good but at least you know there's something we're actually solving here so and you know I don't suggest I think lately they were selling shipping type products we're trying to replace shipping products for the mailing stuff and so they would show up to the US postal office and just like find people who are trying to ship products and just take them out of wine and try to get them lose your product and have some s*** because we're people are really show up and you know your conversion rate is going to be really really low but to go from zero to one to three to four these are kind of things you might have to do what do you do with all these users \n\n -60:-37\n",

              "value": "what the idea is really something like what is the actual problem and so there's a problem relate to me am I really passionate about that problem and then you should think okay with that I have this really great idea about it I'm going to people and then I'm going to watch it on you know I'm going to talk what really happened because he did not get you know maybe you'll get a lot of people with your site but no one sticks around because you didn't understand me back and then you know if you you know looking up you have some money in the bank you might go buy some users but sort of it just widdles out over town end up with the next thing is you should really think about what the the is released you should be able to start in one second and then you should thank you one of the biggest mistakes I've made is you know we started my coconut and I lose my brother and I started a company called pathjoy and in 9 2010 and our goal was basically to you know we have two bowls of mine one is to create the company that made people really happy and and and break something I was very very impactful so far okay and being you know we came up with his therapist so it seemed kind of obviously just creative platforms related pictures of therapist and what happened as a result though was that you know when we started you know sort of useless to us and so it wasn't even a problem you know almost a year trying to do this and so if you just start you know from people here to sleep think about this doing something you don't want to do so say you have you're able to State it where do you think of solutions so the first thing you should do is think of what the industry that you are getting yourself into whether it's big whether it's huge that and there's a number of ways to do this one is you know to really become a copy that industry for a little bit and so it might seem low kind of intuitive to do this because most people say you know if you really want to disrupt an industry you should really not be the no player in it you shouldn't you know someone who spent 20 or 30 years and in history probably because inefficiencies are on our other things that you can want to stop a new like coming into the industry you really should take you one or two months is really understanding what all the little bits and pieces of Industry are and how it works because it's when you get into the detail that's when you start seeing things you can exploit things you can really hit things that are really really beneficial you know people and so an example of this is you know when we start our phone doing we we decided to go we started with the cleaning industry and when we started you know we just were cleaners ourselves and we started playing houses and we found a really quickly was that we were very back there and so as a result you know we said that we don't learn more about this and we went to my book and what books about how to clean which helped me a little bit we learn a little bit more about cleaning supplies but it's sort of like that basketball you know you can watch and you can learn or you can watch and read about vegetables but you're not going to give you better at it if you don't actually do training you know throw basketball around and so we decided one of us basically have to go and learn how to clean and so we went to get trained by you know a professional training program that existed and that meant we actually went to get a job at a cleaning company itself and the cool thing was that you know I learned how to clean from you know training for the few weeks I was there at the cleaning company but even better thing was that I learned a lot about happening company works and in that sense you know I learned why local cleaning company could not become huge like from Joy is today and that's because they have you know they're pretty old school and they had a lot of things just just from anywhere from booking the customer to optimizing the cleaner schedules it was just done very efficiently there's so when you go if you are situation like mine where you know there's a service there's a service element of it you should go and do that service yourself you'll be at work if your thing is going to restaurant you should become aware if if you know painting you know become a painter and kind of getting the shoes of your customers from all angles of what you're trying to build the only thing is there's also a little subscription should be so obsessed to know like what everybody needs to make is doing and it seems like you know all the potential competitors or similar types of companies Google searching it and clicking on every single link and reading every single article from one from like search results and I I found all potential competitors big and small and if they're public I would go read their sons I would go I'll go read all their quarterly financials I would you know sit on the earnings calls you know most of these you'll get more chocolate but they're just these golden nuggets that you'll find once in awhile and you you won't be able to find that unless you actually go through the work of you know getting all of that information in your head so yeah it should become an expert in history now there should be no doubt when you're building this that you are the expert so that people would trust you when you're building this product the second thing is identifying customer segments so you know ideally at the end of the day in the end game you've built a product or business that everybody in the world is using but realistically in the beginning you kind of want to corner off a certain part of the customer base so that you can really optimize for them and that's just you know it's just a matter of focus in a matter of you know just you know whether it's 80 year old teenage girls or whatever it's you know soccer moms it was just be able to you know like say focus a lot on on their needs before you even create a product for you a code down you should really sort of worry about the ideal user experience of how your how you're going to solve the problem and that and that's not just me you know the website itself it's meaning you know how does the customer find out about you know whether it's you know give me an ad or through word of mouth or whatever so they find out about you they come to your site they learn more about you what's all that text say what are you communicating to them to the actual when they sign up for the product so they purchase the service what are they actually getting to after they finish using the product or actually finishes in the service you know there's they're sort of like an evaluation reviews and then put it down a paper and then put it into code and then from there so you have all these ideas in your head Now you kind of know what the core customer base and they just go out with a feature and with the whole user experience a very beginning like is what so no viable products you need to know what is the smallest feature set that you should build to solve the problem that you're trying to solve ved and I think if you go through the whole storyboard experience you can kind of figure out that period we called her to get meet and the second thing is before you put in things in front of the user you should really have your product as simple and a party positioning now and what my what I mean by that is that you know you should be able to go to you know a person and you should be able to say Hey you know this the X Y and me within a sentence and so for example you know at home enjoy it we started off with something actually super complicated like we're in and you can choose new blah blah blah blah and it just went off work Airgas and paragraphs when we present we went to you know potentially users to come on our phone they just get come and get bored after that first first two sentences and so functional benefit of what you do you know in the future when you're trying to build a brand and what night you should you should do you describe so we simply not to change our position ing temper ate so you have a MVP going out there now how do you get your first few years to start trying it so your first person should be you know obvious people the people that you're connected with you should use it obviously a union co-founder to be using it your Mom and Dad should be using it your friends and coworkers should be using it beyond that you want to get more user feedback and so you do okay local community so if you're building consumer products you know they're not influential local community mailing lists especially those for you know parents so those are places you might want to hit up to so when you go to wait we actually try all of these Weezer or something else fine I mean we're on planners so that was pretty easy and then our parents live in Milwaukee so we were basically so that I had to work friends and coworkers are kind of like in San Francisco and elsewhere do you have to pay me to use it dead end of not being able to convince many people to use this from the beginning so what we did was because we're Mountain View some of you guys might know cast retreat they have street fairs there during the summertime and so it go out and basically Chase on people and try to get from the f****** cleaning and almost everyone would say no until one day we took advantage you know it was a very hot and humid day and what we noticed was you know and this is like an any fear people you know there might be arts and crafts and things like that but everybody gravitates towards the food and drink area especially on a hot day so what we did was okay we didn't we figure we need to get in the middle of that and by again in the middle of that we just took water bottles Frozen and then we started hanging out free Free bottles of water we I think we basically Guilt Trip people into looking cleanings but the proof of pudding was that I figured most of the people were Guilt Trip into doing it but when they went home they didn't cancel on us well some of them did but a majority of them did not and so we felt like I thought okay that's good but at least you know there's something we're actually solving here so and you know I don't suggest I think lately they were selling shipping type products we're trying to replace shipping products for the mailing stuff and so they would show up to the US postal office and just like find people who are trying to ship products and just take them out of wine and try to get them lose your product and have some s*** because we're people are really show up and you know your conversion rate is going to be really really low but to go from zero to one to three to four these are kind of things you might have to do what do you do with all these users \n\n -60:-37\n",

            "value": "what the idea is really something like what is the actual problem and so there's a problem relate to me am I really passionate about that problem and then you should think okay with that I have this really great idea about it I'm going to people and then I'm going to watch it on you know I'm going to talk what really happened because he did not get you know maybe you'll get a lot of people with your site but no one sticks around because you didn't understand me back and then you know if you you know looking up you have some money in the bank you might go buy some users but sort of it just widdles out over town end up with the next thing is you should really think about what the the is released you should be able to start in one second and then you should thank you one of the biggest mistakes I've made is you know we started my coconut and I lose my brother and I started a company called pathjoy and in 9 2010 and our goal was basically to you know we have two bowls of mine one is to create the company that made people really happy and and and break something I was very very impactful so far okay and being you know we came up with his therapist so it seemed kind of obviously just creative platforms related pictures of therapist and what happened as a result though was that you know when we started you know sort of useless to us and so it wasn't even a problem you know almost a year trying to do this and so if you just start you know from people here to sleep think about this doing something you don't want to do so say you have you're able to State it where do you think of solutions so the first thing you should do is think of what the industry that you are getting yourself into whether it's big whether it's huge that and there's a number of ways to do this one is you know to really become a copy that industry for a little bit and so it might seem low kind of intuitive to do this because most people say you know if you really want to disrupt an industry you should really not be the no player in it you shouldn't you know someone who spent 20 or 30 years and in history probably because inefficiencies are on our other things that you can want to stop a new like coming into the industry you really should take you one or two months is really understanding what all the little bits and pieces of Industry are and how it works because it's when you get into the detail that's when you start seeing things you can exploit things you can really hit things that are really really beneficial you know people and so an example of this is you know when we start our phone doing we we decided to go we started with the cleaning industry and when we started you know we just were cleaners ourselves and we started playing houses and we found a really quickly was that we were very back there and so as a result you know we said that we don't learn more about this and we went to my book and what books about how to clean which helped me a little bit we learn a little bit more about cleaning supplies but it's sort of like that basketball you know you can watch and you can learn or you can watch and read about vegetables but you're not going to give you better at it if you don't actually do training you know throw basketball around and so we decided one of us basically have to go and learn how to clean and so we went to get trained by you know a professional training program that existed and that meant we actually went to get a job at a cleaning company itself and the cool thing was that you know I learned how to clean from you know training for the few weeks I was there at the cleaning company but even better thing was that I learned a lot about happening company works and in that sense you know I learned why local cleaning company could not become huge like from Joy is today and that's because they have you know they're pretty old school and they had a lot of things just just from anywhere from booking the customer to optimizing the cleaner schedules it was just done very efficiently there's so when you go if you are situation like mine where you know there's a service there's a service element of it you should go and do that service yourself you'll be at work if your thing is going to restaurant you should become aware if if you know painting you know become a painter and kind of getting the shoes of your customers from all angles of what you're trying to build the only thing is there's also a little subscription should be so obsessed to know like what everybody needs to make is doing and it seems like you know all the potential competitors or similar types of companies Google searching it and clicking on every single link and reading every single article from one from like search results and I I found all potential competitors big and small and if they're public I would go read their sons I would go I'll go read all their quarterly financials I would you know sit on the earnings calls you know most of these you'll get more chocolate but they're just these golden nuggets that you'll find once in awhile and you you won't be able to find that unless you actually go through the work of you know getting all of that information in your head so yeah it should become an expert in history now there should be no doubt when you're building this that you are the expert so that people would trust you when you're building this product the second thing is identifying customer segments so you know ideally at the end of the day in the end game you've built a product or business that everybody in the world is using but realistically in the beginning you kind of want to corner off a certain part of the customer base so that you can really optimize for them and that's just you know it's just a matter of focus in a matter of you know just you know whether it's 80 year old teenage girls or whatever it's you know soccer moms it was just be able to you know like say focus a lot on on their needs before you even create a product for you a code down you should really sort of worry about the ideal user experience of how your how you're going to solve the problem and that and that's not just me you know the website itself it's meaning you know how does the customer find out about you know whether it's you know give me an ad or through word of mouth or whatever so they find out about you they come to your site they learn more about you what's all that text say what are you communicating to them to the actual when they sign up for the product so they purchase the service what are they actually getting to after they finish using the product or actually finishes in the service you know there's they're sort of like an evaluation reviews and then put it down a paper and then put it into code and then from there so you have all these ideas in your head Now you kind of know what the core customer base and they just go out with a feature and with the whole user experience a very beginning like is what so no viable products you need to know what is the smallest feature set that you should build to solve the problem that you're trying to solve ved and I think if you go through the whole storyboard experience you can kind of figure out that period we called her to get meet and the second thing is before you put in things in front of the user you should really have your product as simple and a party positioning now and what my what I mean by that is that you know you should be able to go to you know a person and you should be able to say Hey you know this the X Y and me within a sentence and so for example you know at home enjoy it we started off with something actually super complicated like we're in and you can choose new blah blah blah blah and it just went off work Airgas and paragraphs when we present we went to you know potentially users to come on our phone they just get come and get bored after that first first two sentences and so functional benefit of what you do you know in the future when you're trying to build a brand and what night you should you should do you describe so we simply not to change our position ing temper ate so you have a MVP going out there now how do you get your first few years to start trying it so your first person should be you know obvious people the people that you're connected with you should use it obviously a union co-founder to be using it your Mom and Dad should be using it your friends and coworkers should be using it beyond that you want to get more user feedback and so you do okay local community so if you're building consumer products you know they're not influential local community mailing lists especially those for you know parents so those are places you might want to hit up to so when you go to wait we actually try all of these Weezer or something else fine I mean we're on planners so that was pretty easy and then our parents live in Milwaukee so we were basically so that I had to work friends and coworkers are kind of like in San Francisco and elsewhere do you have to pay me to use it dead end of not being able to convince many people to use this from the beginning so what we did was because we're Mountain View some of you guys might know cast retreat they have street fairs there during the summertime and so it go out and basically Chase on people and try to get from the f****** cleaning and almost everyone would say no until one day we took advantage you know it was a very hot and humid day and what we noticed was you know and this is like an any fear people you know there might be arts and crafts and things like that but everybody gravitates towards the food and drink area especially on a hot day so what we did was okay we didn't we figure we need to get in the middle of that and by again in the middle of that we just took water bottles Frozen and then we started hanging out free Free bottles of water we I think we basically Guilt Trip people into looking cleanings but the proof of pudding was that I figured most of the people were Guilt Trip into doing it but when they went home they didn't cancel on us well some of them did but a majority of them did not and so we felt like I thought okay that's good but at least you know there's something we're actually solving here so and you know I don't suggest I think lately they were selling shipping type products we're trying to replace shipping products for the mailing stuff and so they would show up to the US postal office and just like find people who are trying to ship products and just take them out of wine and try to get them lose your product and have some s*** because we're people are really show up and you know your conversion rate is going to be really really low but to go from zero to one to three to four these are kind of things you might have to do what do you do with all these users \n\n -60:-37\n",

              "value": "how many people pay for it but it's to say that you should very if you're going to build a product then eventually you need to you know they're going to pay for it for the get to the point because then that's when you get the real meeting stuff to help you in the future how you can get more paying users to the door all right sure you're getting a lot of feedback and would you do before you officially launch the product so what you want to do is you always want to be building fast right and you want to be optimizing for this Standard Group that is you know you you might have 10 users at this point don't for the point when you have a million users right you want to optimize? and I'm just done with that sometime and and basically that's why it's just many ways of stating that notion manual before animation one of the things that I found when building a Marketplace is that process is very very important over time as you scale but you need not try to automate everything and create software to just you know have a Roblox just run everything which you really should do to understand what and and an example of this is when we started taking on clean professionals on North platform we wouldn't have them we would ask them a bunch of questions over the phone and then in person we ask them what your question too and then they would go to a test clean and then they would and so this took doing all this question asking for that many things you know we have about three weeks three to five percent ago three and so you can imagine all the people who were talking to in the beginning of the funnel day doesn't even made up to apply for it but what happened over time was that we learned certain questions that were asking for that were indicator so whether they're going to be a good or bad performer on the plat we we're just looking at collection I just you know looking at everything by and then you would ask somebody questions in the Enterprise so it's if you try to automate things too fast and you wanted to this you know not being able to move quickly on trying to iterate you know things like an application or something and the third Point here is temporary work messages much better than permanent paralysis find out what I mean is you know Perfection is irrelevant during the growth like you're trying to maybe perfect in this one stage is probably going to not matter anyway and so do not worry about all the edge cases when you're building something just worry about generic case of who your employees are going to be and then as you get bigger and bigger bigger so the body of this and she chases will increase over time and you'll want to you know build for that and lastly Beware of the Frankenstein approach which is great you talk to all these users they give you all these ideas you know the first thing you're going to want to do is go build every single one of them and then go show it to the next day and make them happier you should definitely listen to user feedback but when someone tells you to build a future you shouldn't go build it right now why yes are you going to create it for me while using their product or you know I really need this problem solved before I never going to pay to use this product and so figure that out first instead of Tylenol a bunch of features on which then hides the problem altogether so you have seats and play I think the whole idea of being spelled then you know perfecting the products to to no end is is that email that imitation is is cheaper than innovation in terms of time and and money and capital and so I think everyone should just always assume in general like there's going to be if you have really good idea no matter when you launch someone's going to someone's going to be you know someone's going to fastball you and someone is going to execute as hard as they possibly can to catch up with you and so there's no point in holding out in all that you should feedback that you can get by getting a lot of users all because you feel like you know you feel paranoid that someone's going to do this to you and I paid to keep harping on it but this is things I see today with Founders is something I went through as well and I think unless you're unless you're building something that requires a million dollars you feel ready to get lots of you so what do you do at this point so look at my time so I will go over various textbooks in the next slide but the one thing to note here early on when you are trying to get when it's just you and your co-founder and maybe like help all the people building and so you need to really focus and you need to you should only you're really tempted to try like five different strategies at one time but really what you do is take one channel and Rooney execute on it for an entire week and and just focus on that and then if that works continue it doesn't work you will give a horse for you that that channel that you listen long movie then if you try it only working a 30 year time on it over the course of you know three or four weeks so learn one channel second is always be if when you find channels at work you find strategies at work always the iterating on it you can potentially give it to someone like creative Playbook and give it to somebody else to iterate on it even Google ads but the distribution Channel control change all the time and so you should always iterating optimizing for that and lastly in the beginning you're probably not when you see a channel that fails you you know just get rid of it and go on and move on there as many other things to try but over time go back to those channels and and look at it again so and what I mean by that is an example is in the beginning at Android we have no money so when we try to do we try to buy users from period we tried to buy Google ads to get users in the door quickly and we found was that marinade marinates all these other National companies they have more money than us they were making a lot more money on the job than us and so they were able to pay for users that are much higher and a much higher cast of much higher you're able to wire the matter much higher cost than us and so we couldn't import that and we have to go into another Channel which turn on to be something else but today you know we make more money on the job we're much better restaurants and things and so we should probably revisit that idea of Google in general can be very technically because if it wasn't if it was really easy and blamed everyone would be and so you always have to find that little thing that no one else was doing and and do that too big screen so there are three types of growth when when I'm sticky bar on payroll and hopefully enough time to talk about all of this so really briefly sticky group is trying to get your existing users to come back and pay you more or use you more people talk about you see who's your product and really like it and if you happen to have money in the bank you're going to be able to perhaps use part of that money to 22 Library and the central theme I want to go through is sustainability there is a lot of questionable growth I mean you know you're basically not a leaking bucket money you put in or time you put in as a good return on investment so sticky Groove is like I said getting your existing users to keep buying stuff \n\n -60:-17\n",

here is temporary work messages much better than permanent paralysis find out what I mean is you know Perfection is irrelevant during the growth like you're trying to maybe perfect in this one stage is probably going to not matter anyway and so do not worry about all the edge cases when you're building something just worry about generic case of who your employees are going to be and then as you get bigger and bigger bigger so the body of this and she chases will increase over time and you'll want to you know build for that and lastly Beware of the Frankenstein approach which is great you talk to all these users they give you all these ideas you know the first thing you're going to want to do is go build every single one of them and then go show it to the next day and make them happier you should definitely listen to user feedback but when someone tells you to build a future you shouldn't go build it right now why yes are you going to create it for me while using their product or you know I really need this problem solved before I never going to pay to use this product and so figure that out first instead of Tylenol a bunch of features on which then hides the problem altogether so you have seats and play I think the whole idea of being spelled then you know perfecting the products to to no end is is that email that imitation is is cheaper than innovation in terms of time and and money and capital and so I think everyone should just always assume in general like there's going to be if you have really good idea no matter when you launch someone's going to someone's going to be you know someone's going to fastball you and someone is going to execute as hard as they possibly can to catch up with you and so there's no point in holding out in all that you should feedback that you can get by getting a lot of users all because you feel like you know you feel paranoid that someone's going to do this to you and I paid to keep harping on it but this is things I see today with Founders is something I went through as well and I think unless you're unless you're building something that requires a million dollars you feel ready to get lots of you so what do you do at this point so look at my time so I will go over various textbooks in the next slide but the one thing to note here early on when you are trying to get when it's just you and your co-founder and maybe like help all the people building and so you need to really focus and you need to you should only you're really tempted to try like five different strategies at one time but really what you do is take one channel and Rooney execute on it for an entire week and and just focus on that and then if that works continue it doesn't work you will give a horse for you that that channel that you listen long movie then if you try it only working a 30 year time on it over the course of you know three or four weeks so learn one channel second is always be if when you find channels at work you find strategies at work always the iterating on it you can potentially give it to someone like creative Playbook and give it to somebody else to iterate on it even Google ads but the distribution Channel control change all the time and so you should always iterating optimizing for that and lastly in the beginning you're probably not when you see a channel that fails you you know just get rid of it and go on and move on there as many other things to try but over time go back to those channels and and look at it again so and what I mean by that is an example is in the beginning at Android we have no money so when we try to do we try to buy users from period we tried to buy Google ads to get users in the door quickly and we found was that marinade marinates all these other National companies they have more money than us they were making a lot more money on the job than us and so they were able to pay for users that are much higher and a much higher cast of much higher you're able to wire the matter much higher cost than us and so we couldn't import that and we have to go into another Channel which turn on to be something else but today you know we make more money on the job we're much better restaurants and things and so we should probably revisit that idea of Google in general can be very technically because if it wasn't if it was really easy and blamed everyone would be and so you always have to find that little thing that no one else was doing and and do that too big screen so there are three types of growth when when I'm sticky bar on payroll and hopefully enough time to talk about all of this so really briefly sticky group is trying to get your existing users to come back and pay you more or use you more people talk about you see who's your product and really like it and if you happen to have money in the bank you're going to be able to perhaps use part of that money to 22 Library and the central theme I want to go through is sustainability there is a lot of questionable growth I mean you know you're basically not a leaking bucket money you put in or time you put in as a good return on investment so sticky Groove is like I said getting your existing users to keep buying stuff \n\n -60:-17\n",

17% retention easily if you can connect people with the thing that makes the second thing to think about is everyone is wrong single goes oh I'm getting too many notifications I think that's what we need to optimize for a notifications okay are your power users leaving your site because of they're getting too many notifications then why would you optimize that they're probably grown up something you still what you need to focus again our experience about products and by the way like building an awesome product is all about thinking about Empower users right building incredible products is definitely optimizing for the people use your product the most but driving growth people who are already using your product all the time and not the one you have to worry about there's also talk about our growth accounting framework will be used to think about the grow th and we looked at new users resurrected uses people we work on Facebook for 30 days that came back and shown uses and the resurrection numbers were pretty much every product I've ever seen dominate the news friends getting them for whatever number of friends think so think about using the margin don't even think about when yourself playing so operating the growth what you really need to think about is what is the normal star of your company what is the one metric where everyone in the company is thinking about it and driving their photos take the so this is you and that you know you when they are sick with for a long time and knows the magic mirror on that metro stuff and think about those I think the really important points when you're operating the group everything has to come from so the last area here is tactics My Hope was that I could hear a few of these and then I've got a list of whatever on that you can ask me questions about they work better I don't believe it I believe you actually have to work there's a good article again in the lecture page from interviewing Ben Silverman we talked about how the growth the Pinterest was driven by marketing and it's a really good artillery into books so the first time Facebook International one of the biggest barriers to our long-term growth and one of the biggest things we had to deal with was all the countries where they were close friends they should be outside have fakebook.css in it was studied outside as a player Club contacts there were all these different social networks around the world that grew up on Facebook was focused on emails and so internationalizing was an important barrier because it is not down I'm not down married or because I don't know so college students launch again oncologist but that was Place Ultra decides by then expanding High School to everyone that was like just before I joined and that was a shocking moment and I stood the road from 50 million and then we had a great wall and when we hit that break all that was the point when a lot of extra special questions were being asked cuz I took about whether any social network are adding it more than 100 million between 50 and 100 million uses and we will worry that it wasn't possible brought a bunch of together it was he said very publicly but he wanted to buy me a multiple occasions and he probably should have done but without a really weird bunch of people but it worked out and the two things we did I think that really really drove initially was number one we focused on that 10% of 14 days and getting used to the magic is it causation is it correlation but like if you really think of no one gets a friend that they'll be on Facebook are you crazy the second thing was internationalization and when we launched it I think there were two things that we did really well number one was even though we were late and we were stressed about being late we took the time to build in the schedule one we move slow to move fast you can actually repair the full story from Naomi and one of the videos making the lecture page but what we do is you wrap to all the strings in the site and then BT I was out of translation script and then or extrapolation extraction script and then we created the community translation of platform so that we didn't just have professional translators translate from the site and we got the French translator but we managed to get to this day without 104 languages translated by Facebook for Facebook 1870 of those translated by the community and we took the time to build something that would make us to scale languages so back then the right languages so close some French it's half German in Spanish now look at that list that's today's distribution of langu ages Italian isn't on the list anymore French and German are about to fall on in the last year we quadrupled the number of people on Facebook in Hindi quadruple and so building for where the world is today is an easy mistake to make and it's what a lot on the other social networks did we built scalable translation infrastructure that actually enabled us to attack all of the languages so we can be ready for where the future is going to it's going to be Summit in it but that way we want to go to language translations later today because I think they're talking about the stuff that I want to go through now and I'll stick with the delightful for that stuff but I really encourage you guys because I go to the end if you've got any questions about them let me know I think this should be like pretty cool time anyway s there's a great book the book on the right here by Adam sandenberg viral Loop goes through a bunch of case studies of companies that have grown through viral marketing and I strongly encourage you if you're interested if I'm asking to get a book I think ugly and advertising straight as well because chapter 7 is like if you can't think of anything else stick in the car to a billboard with super glue and people like he saw some really before he told us about like he when when I joined Facebook which is the thing about my reality for a product in terms of three things first is Halo so how many people can you pick with any given vinyl blast second \n\n -56:-53\n",
