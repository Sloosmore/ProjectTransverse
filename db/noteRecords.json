Each node in the network uses a linear combination of feature vectors and associated weights.\n- Vocabulary: \n  - **Approximator**: In machine learning and statistics, an approximator is a method or learning algorithm that seeks to approximate a target function through training on example inputs, and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outputs.\n\n## Understanding the Perceptron Training Process\n2024-01-17T03:20:32.067Z\n- Perceptron training minimizes misclassifications\n- Misclassifications are minimized using absolute value\n- Weight updating is based on data points and their associated calculations\n- Learning rate multiplied by the distance between the approximation and the actual value\n\n## Training a model\n2024-01-17T03:21:48.840Z\n- Start with the weights being small, not too big to avoid issues with training.\n- Perform steps for each data point, including calculating the linear combination, applying an activation function, and updating the weights.\n\n## Perceptron Training Process \n2024-01-17T03:22:59.749Z\n- Updating weights in each step for each data point\n- Calculating the error and updating weights until a very small error is achieved\n\n## Linearly Classifiable Data and Neural Networks\n2024-01-17T03:25:44.088Z\n- Linearly classifiable data: Data that can be separated into different classes using a straight line or hyperplane\n- Neural networks: A series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates\n\n## New AI Architecture\n2024-01-17T03:27:15.177Z\n- The new AI architecture on Netflix involves a dual network with multiple layers. \n- It utilizes activation functions such as sigmoid function, real or logistics function, and hyperbolic tan function to replace the step function.\n- The architecture emphasizes the use of non-linearities in constructing multilayer neural networks.\n\n## Neural Network Definition\n2024-01-17T03:29:09.085Z\n- The network is defined as starting at the end and working backward, with the output being an activation function of the output weights times the output of the final layer. \n- Each layer is defined by a number of \"Lambda\" nodes, with all nodes connected to each other, creating a fully connected feedforward network.\n\n## Neural Network Structure\n2024-01-17T03:32:14.821Z\n- The output of a neural network depends non-linearly on the last layer, and this layer depends on the previous layer and so on, creating a recursive structure within the network.\n- The network can be visualized as an onion, starting with the output and then working back to the input, with calculations being made as it progresses backward through the layers.\n\n## Universal Approximation Theorem\n2024-01-17T03:33:17.509Z\n- The universal approximation theorem, first articulated in 1989, states that a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate any continuous function on compact subsets.\n- Compact subsets are subsets that include their boundary and do not have to satisfy specific constraints on their nature.\n\n## Multi-class Classification and Softmax\n2024-01-17T03:35:46.043Z\n- The raw output of the network is passed through a sigmoid function, mapping the values to a range between 0 and 1, to obtain the probability for each class in a multi-class classification.\n- The issue with using the sigmoid function alone is that the probabilities assigned to each class do not necessarily add up to one, hence creating ambiguity in classification.\n- This method is referred to as multi-class classification, where multiple classes can be associated with the input.\n\n## Sigmoid and Softmax Functions\n2024-01-17T03:37:29.206Z\n- Sigmoid function used in final layer for multi-class classification\n    - Sigmoid function does not ensure probabilities add up to one\n    - Allows for classification into multiple classes\n- Softmax function exaggerates differences in probabilities and ensures sum of probabilities equals one\n    - Enables exclusive belonging or mapping to a class\n\n## Softmax and Multi-Class Classification\n2024-01-17T03:38:30.789Z\n- Softmax ensures that the output values add up to one, which is essential in binary classification to obtain a classification probability.\n- In multi-class classification, you may want to compare probabilities between different outcomes, such as distinguishing between various objects in an image.\n- Softmax exaggerates the distances between classes, making them not directly comparable, which might not be suitable if you want to rank the different classes based on their probabilities.\n\n## Softmax and Cross Entropy Loss\n2024-01-17T03:40:46.085Z\n- Softmax: A function that takes as input a vector of K real numbers, and normalizes it into a probability distribution consisting of K probabilities.\n- Softmax is used in neural networks to provide probabilities for the different classes in a classification problem.\n- Cross Entropy Loss: A loss function used in neural networks when the output is a probability value. It measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. \n\n## Cross Entropy Loss\n2024-01-17T03:42:03.824Z\n- Cross entropy loss is very similar to the negative log likelihood and is used in models.\n- In the case of two classes, cross entropy loss becomes the same as the negative log likelihood equation.\n- The derivation of cross entropy loss comes from taking the logarithm and maximizing the likelihood function.\n\n\n## Softmax Activation Function\n2024-01-17T03:43:11.596Z\n- The softmax activation function is used as the final activation function, providing output probabilities that add up to one.\n- It helps in determining a clear winner among the classes in the model.",
