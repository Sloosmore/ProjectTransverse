      <h1>404</h1>
      <p>Page not found! Just like my notes when I need to study ðŸ˜­</p>
      <p>
        Btw dysgraphia is a pain and is why half this website is mispelled and
        the other half is ai content (litteraly thats the product)
      </p>
      <p>It would be funny making this page a blog</p>
      <p>
        I may regret this later but send me an email (stan@vrse.ai) or text me
        (206-372-0327) if you have feedback I would love to make this thing
        better
      </p>
    </div>
