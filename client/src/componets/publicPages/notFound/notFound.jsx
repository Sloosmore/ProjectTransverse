        the other half is ai content (litteraly thats the product)
      </p>
      <p>It would be funny making this page a blog</p>
      <p>I may regret this later but send me an email: ssloosmore@yahoo.com</p>

/* 
What does excitement in learning mean to me? 
In my opionion it can mean a few things. 
The first that comes to mind is knowing that the informaiton learned will have a real impact in the future.
This allows me to really engage with the material because I know that I will be set up in the future when a challege in this domain occurs
Second is when the content is guenuenly interesting and posses a hypothetical that there is not concessess on.
